The first call in sequence is initialization of Customer object. The customer object initiates Order object through sendOrder() message. 
The Order object then Confirms the order and initiates Normal or Special Order object based on the type of Order. 
The Special or Normal order object then calls Dispatch() method to dispatch the order, for this a self call to the object is performed. After successful execution of the function call, return messages are passed back to the calling objects.
